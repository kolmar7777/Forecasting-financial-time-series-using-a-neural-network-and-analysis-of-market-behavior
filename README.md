# Forecasting-financial-time-series-using-a-neural-network-and-analysis-of-market-behavior
This repository contains the project code that solves the problem of time series prediction using neural networks. 
## Structure
The project uses the .ipynb file as a representative for full-blown interaction.

A separate part of the implementation without using .ipynb placed on this project, but now it's demo

## Usage
* To run the code with loading fresh data from SimFin servers, you need to run AI_for_financial_Time_Series without additional arguments.
Example:
```bash
$ python3 AI_for_financial_Time_Series.py
```
* To run the code loading data from directory databases you need to run AI_for_financial_Time_Series with any additional argument (file name is possible).
Example: 
```bash
$ python3 AI_for_financial_Time_Series.py filename.txt
```
